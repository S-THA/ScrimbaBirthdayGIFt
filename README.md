# BIRTHDAY GIFt Site

This project was fun to work on, maybe because it had a personal touch to it.
Alot of CSS styling were used and I enjoyed getting to know how and when to use them.

1. Used the shadow effect on text to help deal with the poor contrast score for our color combination
2. Used multiple selector at once in the CSS
3. Used Flex along with flex-direction and align-item 
4. Replaced img with a div to enable us declare it as background-image in CSS using url("image path")
5. Also used background-size property with the cover and when cover did not work, used width and height values
6. Used the hover effect on the GIFt boxes to reveal the GIFts
7. Finished it off by making the background colour have a linear-gradient effect

Fun all the way.
Best part, this page is 100% responsive.
