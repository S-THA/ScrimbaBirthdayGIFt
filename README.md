# BIRTHDAY GIFt Site

This project was fun to work on, maybe because it had a personal touch to it.
Alot of CSS styling were used and I enjoyed getting to know how and when to use them.
-Used the shadow effect on text to help deal with the poor contrast score for our color combination
-Used multiple selector at once in the CSS
-Used Flex along with flex-direction and align-item 
-Replaced img with a div to enable us declare it as background-image in CSS using url("image path")
-Also used background-size property with the cover and when cover did not work, used width and height values
-Used the hover effect on the GIFt boxes to reveal the GIFts
-Finished it off by making the background colour have a linear-gradient effect

Fun all the way.
Best part, this page is 100% responsive.
